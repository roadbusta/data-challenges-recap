    "> The **`CIFAR-10`** dataset (Canadian Institute For Advanced Research) is a collection of images that are commonly used to train machine learning and computer vision algorithms. It is one of the most widely used datasets for machine learning research. The CIFAR-10 dataset contains 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes. The 10 different classes represent airplanes, cars, birds, cats, deer, dogs, frogs, horses, ships, and trucks. There are 6,000 images of each class.\n",

    "⭐️ This dataset is emblematic in the research community as many enhancements for image recognition have been achieved on this dataset. Once researchers achieved great performances on this dataset, they moved to a more advanced one, the CIFAR-100.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the [University of Toronto](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html):\n",
    "\n",
    "> This dataset is just like the CIFAR-10, except it has 100 classes containing 600 images each. There are 500 training images and 100 testing images per class. The 100 classes in the CIFAR-100 are grouped into 20 superclasses. Each image comes with a \"fine\" label (the class to which it belongs) and a \"coarse\" label (the superclass to which it belongs).\n",
