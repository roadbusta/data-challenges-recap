    "👉 There exists a very particular architecture in Deep Learning called **`Autoencoders`**. Autoencoders are Neural Network architectures trained to return **outputs that are as similar as possible to the original inputs fed to them**. Why would we do that ?  \n",

    "\n",
    "There are two parts in an autoencoder: the  **`encoder`** and the **`decoder`**.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In the encoder, we will make the information flow through different dense layers with a decreasing number of neurons. It will create a **`bottleneck`** where the information is somewhat compressed.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. In the decoder, we will try to create the original data based on the compressed data.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔥 <u>***Why is it powerful, useful ?***</u>\n",
    "\n",
    "If it works well, it means two important things:\n",
    "\n",
    "* ✅ We can afford to **compress our dataset** and use a compressed version of it when fitting another Neural Network ! \n",
    "\n",
    "* ✅ The **information contained in the bottleneck** - i.e. the data compressed in a low-dimensional layer - **accurately captures the patterns of our dataset** and the autoencoder is able to decode the compressed information !\n",
