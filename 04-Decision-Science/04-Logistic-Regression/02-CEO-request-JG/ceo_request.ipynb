    "- We have seen that `wait_time` was the most significant factor behind low review scores, but reading comments of the bad reviews also showed that some of them were linked to the seller or to the product itself.\n",
    "- `wait_time` is made up of seller's `delay_to_carrier` + `carrier_delivery_time`. The latter being outside of Olist's direct control, improving it is not a quick-win recommendation we can make to Olist CEO without in-depth analysis of their operational practices.\n",
    "- On the contrary, a better selection of `sellers` can positively impact the `delay_to_carrier` and reduce the number of bad `review_scores` on Olist.\n",
